# Histogram



Required exercises:

1.) How do you go about reading in characters from a file? Write and test a method that returns the next character in a file. Note that you have to do something with the carriage returns - such as ignoring them - and that you have to decide what to do when there are no characters to be returned.

2.) How do you write a String to a file? How do you write an Integer to a file? An int? How do you create a file, anyway?

3.) Now the fun begins! Write a Java application to read in a file character by character, counting the frequencies with which each character occurs. When there are no more characters, create a file frequency.txt and output the frequencies for each character.

4.) Output a histogram of the character frequencies. One simple kind of histogram has horizontal lines proportional to the magnitude of the number it represents. For example:

A : **********
B : *****
C : ******

5.) What is the complexity of your algorithm?
